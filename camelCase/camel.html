    <h1>CamelCase</h1>
        <p>
            Given a string, return its camel case version using the following rules:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Words in the string argument are separated by one or more characters 
                    from the following set: space ( ), dash (-), or underscore (_). Treat 
                    any sequence of these as a word break.
                </li>
                <li>The first word should be all lowercase.</li>
                <li>
                    Each subsequent word should start with an uppercase letter, with 
                    the rest of it lowercase.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All spaces and separators should be removed.
                </li>
            </ul>
