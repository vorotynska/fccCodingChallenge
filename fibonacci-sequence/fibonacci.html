    <h1>Fibonacci Sequence</h1>
    <p>
        The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is 
        the sum of the two preceding ones. When starting with 0 and 1, 
        the first 10 numbers in the sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given an array containing the first two numbers of a Fibonacci sequence, 
        and an integer representing the length of the sequence, return an array 
        containing the sequence of the given length.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your function should handle sequences of any length greater than or equal to zero.</li>
        <li>If the length is zero, return an empty array.</li>
        <li>Note that the starting numbers are part of the sequence.</li>
    </ul>
