    <h1>Candelelight</h1>
    <p>
        Given an integer representing the number of candles 
        you start with, and an integer representing how many 
        burned candles it takes to create a new one, return 
        the number of candles you will have used after creating 
        and burning as many as you can.
    </p>
    <p>
     For example, if given 7 candles and it takes 2 burned candles to make a new one:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Burn 7 candles to get 7 leftovers,</li>
        <li>Recycle 6 leftovers into 3 new candles (1 leftover remains),</li>
        <li>Burn 3 candles to get 3 more leftovers (4 total),</li>
        <li>Recycle 4 leftovers into 2 new candles,</li>
        <li>Burn 2 candles to get 2 leftovers,</li>
        <li>Recycle 2 leftovers into 1 new candle,</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
