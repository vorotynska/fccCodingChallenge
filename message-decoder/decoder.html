    <h1>Message Decoder</h1>
    <p>
        Given a secret message string, and an integer representing the number
        of letters that were used to shift the message to encode it, return the
        decoded string.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A positive number means the message was shifted forward in the alphabet.</li>
        <li>A negative number means the message was shifted backward in the alphabet.</li>
        <li>Case matters, decoded characters should retain the case of their encoded counterparts.</li>
        <li>Non-alphabetical characters should not get decoded.</li>
    </ul>
