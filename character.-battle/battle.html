    <h1>Character Batlle</h1>
    <p>
        Given two strings representing your army and an opposing army, 
        each character from your army battles the character at the same 
        position from the opposing army using the following rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Characters a-z have a strength of 1-26, respectively.</li>
        <li>Characters A-Z have a strength of 27-52, respectively.</li>
        <li>Digits 0-9 have a strength of their face value.</li>
        <li>All other characters have a value of zero.</li>
        <li>Each character can only fight one battle.</li>
        <p>
            For each battle, the stronger character wins. The army with 
            more victories, wins the war. Return the following values:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Opponent retreated" if your army has more characters than the opposing army.</li>
            <li>"We retreated" if the opposing army has more characters than yours.</li>
            <li>"We won" if your army won more battles.</li>
            <li>"We lost" if the opposing army won more battles.</li>
            <li>"It was a tie" if both armies won the same number of battles.</li> 
        </ul>
    </ul>
