    <h1>Unorder of Operations</h1>
    <p>
        Given an array of integers and an array of string 
        operators, apply the operations to the numbers s
        equentially from left-to-right. Repeat the operations 
        as needed until all numbers are used. Return the final result.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and ['+', '*'], return 
        the result of evaluating 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 from left-to-right 
        ignoring standard order of operations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Valid operators are +, -, *, /, and %.
